  "description": "It’s an adorable everyday comedy about young ladies(?). All  kinds of “Cute”. It's a story about girls with different personalities, circumstances, dreams, who are living their lives. It's a springtime of youth. If I were to give an English title for Jyoshi no Teniwoha, I’d make it simply “ALL ABOUT GIRLS”.",
